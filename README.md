This is designed to pull information from N-Central and export it to a CSV. There is also a function to generate a processor list to calculate hardware age for the audit.

Generate your JWT and input your server at the top of the code and you can then use it to pull information.

AMP files provided for N-Central property updates.

If anyone is able to help develop this further please get in touch. I think the ultimate aim is to make everything work and potentially even get to a GUI.

Not possible without the fantastic PS-NCentral tool you can find more information on here https://github.com/ToschAutomatisering/PS-NCentral. Massive thanks for their work on the module.

Note: Requires Powershell 7.
